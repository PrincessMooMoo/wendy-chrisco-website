			<p class="light-blue text-justify line-spacing">My artwork is many things. Original? Sometimes yes. Sometimes my art is heavily influenced by other creators. And then sometimes, it is way out there. How did this idea for a t-shirt print get so weird?</p>
			
			<p class="light-blue text-justify line-spacing">I have worked in many different mediums in the past. First, it was just pencil and paper. Then I had a traditional art phase in college with watercolors and oil paints. Now I work exclusively in vectors (also known as Illustrator). Vectors can be used in everything and can be any size. So many different possibilities.</p>
			
			<p class="light-blue text-justify line-spacing">What is my subject? Well for the longest time, I was heavily into dragons and other fantastical creatures. Still am, can't help it. Once I got into the real world though, that changed into making artwork for the customer. You want a donkey smoking a cigar? I can do that. How about just a classical shield for a school? That's fine as well. Just a nice, bold logo for a new start-up? Nothing is restricted.</p>
			
			<p class="light-blue text-justify line-spacing">So you got yourself an idea. Where do I put this idea? I know many places. T-shirts? Banners? A website? Maybe even something like lapel pins or medals? I know many different size formats. Nothing is too challenging for this smart cookie.</p>
			
			<p class="light-blue text-justify line-spacing">Please take a look at my portfolio if you want to get an idea of what I can do. Also feel free to contact me with any questions. My about page also has some content that may be to your liking.</p>
