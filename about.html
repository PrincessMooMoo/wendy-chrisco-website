        		<p class="text-align-center dark-gray">I enjoy a good walk on the beach, like anyone, but you know what is also nice? Talking about myself.</p>
        		<p class="text-align-center dark-gray">Once there was a wee spark in my mind as a child. A spark that reads "You wanna escape this world." So I began to draw in my notepad with every free time I had. Even during class. Fortunately, I didn't have teachers that discouraged my drawing habit. Quite the opposite. They wanted to fuel my addiction with projects that involved me drawing. "Make it pretty!"</p>
        		<p class="text-align-center dark-gray">Going forward a few years, now I am in college. I was influenced by my high school counselor that I should take up graphic design. I did so, but also pursued illustration under the direction of Doug Hansen. I graduated in 2008 with high honors. Well, of course there was more to it than that. I was highly involved with the shenanigans called the marching band and all the drama that comes with dorm life. I also met my husband in college, and things were never the same since.</p>
        		<p class="text-align-center dark-gray">I graduated from college and entered the work force, like any good citizen. Worked at a small company for about 6 years. I enjoyed the pace and making friends with my coworkers, but I was getting bored. I wanted to learn something new and challenging. It was during this time that I discovered my new calling: mathematics.</p>
        	
        		<p class="text-align-center dark-gray">I know what you may be thinking. "EW!" Well, I don't blame you. I had the adversity for math for the majority of my life. I didn't trust myself at all with something as simple as addition. I took on math not just because of boredom, but because I recognized a flaw and wanted to fix it. I didn't realize that I wanted to go even further with math. Now I have returned to college and in hopes of getting a Master's degree.</p>
